                            <h2>My brief biography</h2>
                            <p>Amanda Tumusiime is a painter, feminist, activist, art historian, an Associate Professor in the Department of Visual Communication and Multimedia at Makerere University, Uganda and teaches Visual Communication Design, Art History and Visual Culture. She is a Senior Research Associate at the Department of Fine Arts, Rhodes University in South Africa. </p>
                            <p>She obtained a bachelor’s degree in Industrial and Fine Arts (BIFA) and an MA (Fine Art) from Makerere University, an MA (Arts) from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in the Department of Art History, and a Doctor of Literature and Philosophy (DLitt et Phil) in history of art at the University of South Africa. She is a Presidential Fellow of the African Studies Association, a Fulbright Scholar, a Fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies and a Fellow of the Carnegie Next Generation of African Academics and a Maya Angelou Recipient. </p>
                            <p>Her research interests cut across feminism, art history activism and art practice. These multi-disciplinary focus enables her to examine the way in which patriarchal perceptions influence the images through which young girls, grass-roots women, the deaf and the elderly are ‘othered’ in cultural discourses expressed through the medium of art and other forms of culture. Tumusiime advocates the inclusion of these marginalised vulnerable groups. Through her art practice she has put up seven solo art exhibitions, has participated in over 30 group shows and has published in African Arts Journal, Start Journal CPAN and in Humanities Review Journal of Delta State University, Abraka, Nigeria.</p>
                            <p>Tumusiime has received numerous collaborative awards and grants from various sources, e.g. from the African Studies Association as an ASA Presidential Fellow hosted at Princeton University, as a Fulbright African Research Scholar at1. 2University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, as a Fellow of the Carnegie Next Generation of AfricanAcademics (NGAA II) at Makerere University and as a Fellow of the American Council for Learned Societies – African Humanities Programme (AHP), Carnegie Corporation of New York, hosted at Rhodes University.</p>
