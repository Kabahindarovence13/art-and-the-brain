        "<p> This is because in the mid-1930s she introduced the teaching of contemporary art at Makerere University and wrote widely on issues concerning family, women and children. On the other hand, she also created art though only few of her artworks are in Uganda.</p>", 
        "<p> However, on my part I am interested in a lino print, entitled Mother and Child (1940s), whose visual archive I have accessed through George Kyeyune (2003) and Angelo Kakande (2008). The print captures a dominant sitting mother-figure wrapped in white cloth and nursing a child. Trowell’s print seems to suggest the earliest expressions of her self-activism to emancipate mothers and children through modern art. I re-read Trowell’s Mother and Child and its multiplicity of meanings. I re-engage it to retrace the threads of the colonial hegemony that wove together Trowell’s instruction of modern art in Uganda. This debate is essential. It sets the gendered pedestal on which contemporary art in Uganda was born and became interlaced with – to use Trowell’s words – ‘warps and wefts’ (Trowell 1957) This paper, therefore, marks our entry into the gendered discourses that have continued to shape Uganda’s modern art to the present.</p>"

        "body":  ["<p>Kampala, Uganda | DOMINIC MUWANGUZI | Art is about  humanity; how people live, relate and respond to what surrounds them. On the other hand, Philanthropy is the act of improving the welfare of others through generous donations, usually inform of money. As such, since art is used to express and communicate what goes on in the wider society, and the fact that it greatly survives on patronage, it would be sufficient to  conclude that Art and Philanthropy are synonymous. Since the beginning of civilization, art has been used as a medium of supporting good causes. In the middle ages and after that period, the aristocratic class would use art as a medium of reaching out to the underprivileged societies. In fact the support  to artists like Michael Angelo, Leonardo Da Vinci and Caravaggio by their patrons was a gesture of Philanthropy.</p>"

Native Voices International empowers people to use art, film, music, drama, storytelling performances and sports as tools for self-determination. It recognises and rewards people who enrich their vision through giving out various awards.  The Maya Angelou Award is one of the many awards this organisation gives out every year to the most outstanding person. This person has to have a vision similar to that of Maya Angelou who was an American poet, singer, memoirist and civil rights activist and who used these forms of art to empower her community. Dr Tumusiime was nominated alongside many other reputable Ugandan contestants, such as Anne Kansiime. She was later voted winner by the Ugandan community in view of her being an artist and an activist who uses art to empower Ugandan society, especially the girl child, through education. She uses her artworks to raise funds in the hope of building a hostel for the girls in her home area as a strategy to keep girls in school, a model she hopes to replicate countrywide.</p>",
